Today, I participated in a thesis from one of my seniors. He is developing a Mario-like game to research user experience using a brain-computer interface to control your character’s actions instead of a keyboard.

> What is a brain-computer interface (BCI)? The technology allows people to control devices or communicate directly with a computer using their brain signals. The basic idea is to interpret brain signals and translate them into commands that a computer or device can understand.

This is my first time using a BCI device. It is fascinating how we can play a game with just our thoughts. However, it wasn’t easy when I first tried to exercise my brain on a simple action, such as lifting a box.

In terms of user experience, this is an incredible feature, but I find it challenging to get familiar with the device. It is uncomfortable when you cannot control the actions with your brain compared to doing them easily using a keyboard. On the other hand, since this is my first time and I only had a few minutes to get used to the device, I do not doubt that controlling the actions with your brain is way more satisfying once you can fully control it.

It has not been many decades since this idea was introduced. I think this technology has way more room to grow and improve. In the video game industry, the device must be more user-friendly, making it easier to control with users’ brains. However, the device used in this thesis is not the latest version.
