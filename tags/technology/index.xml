He is developing a Mario-like game to research user experience using a brain-computer interface to control your character’s actions instead of a keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is a brain-computer interface (BCI)? The technology allows people to control devices or communicate directly with a computer using their brain signals. The basic idea is to interpret brain signals and translate them into commands that a computer or device can understand.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is my first time using a BCI device. It is fascinating how we can play a game with just our thoughts. However, it wasn’t easy when I first tried to exercise my brain on a simple action, such as lifting a box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In terms of user experience, this is an incredible feature, but I find it challenging to get familiar with the device. It is uncomfortable when you cannot control the actions with your brain compared to doing them easily using a keyboard. On the other hand, since this is my first time and I only had a few minutes to get used to the device, I do not doubt that controlling the actions with your brain is way more satisfying once you can fully control it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, this is an excellent technology to help those who cannot or are struggling to use a keyboard or a controller to play a game. Allow them to play a game using their brains’ activities even though this version of the device used in the thesis does not support people wearing glasses like me. I hope the more recent version of the device will be able to solve this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has not been many decades since this idea was introduced. I think this technology has way more room to grow and improve. In the video game industry, the device must be more user-friendly, making it easier to control with users’ brains. However, the device used in this thesis is not the latest version. &lt;a class="link" href="https://emotiv.gitbook.io/insight-2-user-manual/introduction/introduction-to-insight-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
